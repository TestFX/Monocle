## Create Signed Bundle
Signed Maven bundles can be generated by building the project as usual and then
using the bundle.sh script to generate the bundle for deployment to Maven
Central.

## Uploading Maven Bundles for Monocle
1. Sign in to https://oss.sonatype.org (TestFX artifacts are hosted on the old oss.sontatype.org server)
2. In the guide on the left click on 'Staging Upload'
3. For 'Upload Mode' choose 'Artifact Bundle'
4. Click the 'Select Bundle to Upload...' button
5. Navigate to and select the signed bundle on your local machine
6. Click the 'Upload Bundle' button

After the bundle is uploaded, Maven Central will process the bundle. The results of the upload and processing can be viewed by
1. In the guide on the left click on 'Staging Repositories'
2. Select the repository corresponding to the bundle upload
3. In the tabbed pane select the 'Activity' tab
4. Review the actions taken and resolve any issues found
