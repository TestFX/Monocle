## Uploading Maven Bundles for Monocle

Signed Maven bundles can be generated by building the project as usual and then 
using the bundle.sh script to generate the bundle for deployment to Maven 
Central. Deploying to Maven Central is done in three steps:
1. Generate the signed bundle
2. Upload the bundle to https://oss.sonatype.org
3. Approve the bundle for release
